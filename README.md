# Classification Model - ExtraaLearn-Project

This is a Data Science project where I performed end-to-end analysis, classification model building, and provided product recommendations given a dataset called 'ExtraaLearn.csv'. 

In Jupyter Notebooks, a data description was provided for the columns of the dataset; from there, I performed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, decision tree and random forest classifier model building, hyperparameter tuning, and developed recommendations based on important features to the target variable.
